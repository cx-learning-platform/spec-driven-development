# VIBE Coding Workflow

**V**erified, **I**ntelligent, **B**usiness-centric, **E**ngineered  

---

## üìå Overview
The **VIBE coding workflow** is a systematic approach to software development that emphasizes **verification, intelligence, business alignment, and engineering excellence**.  

This methodology ensures that every project moves from business needs to production-ready code through clearly defined stages with specific roles, inputs, and outputs.

## üîÑ Workflow Steps

| Stage | Role / System | Input | Output / Artifact | Comments |
|:------|:--------------|:------|:------------------|:---------|
| **Requirements** | Product Owner | Business Needs | Product Requirements Document (PRD) | Single source of truth |
| **Specification** | Developer (with AI prompts) | PRD | Software Requirements Specification (SRS) | Formalizes requirements |
| **Estimation** | Developer (with AI prompts) | SRS | Estimation Document (Effort, Timeline, Complexity) | Clear estimates before design |
| **Design** | Developer / Task Master MCP (AI) | SRS | Design / Architecture Document | High-level & low-level designs |
| **Task Breakdown** | Developer / Task Master MCP (AI) | Design Document | Task List (Jira/Agile Board Tickets) | Design auto-converted to tasks |
| **Task Execution** | Developer / Task Master MCP (AI) + MCP servers | Task List | Code / Tests | Code and tests generated & executed |
